## Hello!

Welcome to my personal academic homepage! I'm Hao Shan (镡昊), an undergraduate student at Beihang University - Beijing University of Technology (Dual Degree Program).

### Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- **Online HD Map Construction**: Efficient vectorized map construction for autonomous driving
- **3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction**: Camera-based 3D scene understanding
- **End-to-End Autonomous Driving**: Planning and perception algorithms

### What You'll Find Here

- My **publications** at ICLR, CVPR, IV, IEEE TITS/TMM
- **Education** and **internship** experience (Xiaomi, etc.)
- **Project** and **honors** information
- Blog posts (when I have time to write!)

Feel free to explore my publications, check out my projects, or reach out via the contact information in the sidebar. I'm always happy to connect with fellow researchers!
